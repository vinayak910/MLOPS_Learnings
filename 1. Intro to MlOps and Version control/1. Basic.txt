MLOps : combination of two words . 
1. ML: Machine learning
2. OP : operations (software development)

The purpose of Mlops is to deploy a model in such a way : 

1. Scalable : able to handle large users. 
2. Reproducibility : Efficieny which is in local should be same and maintained after the deployment
3. Automation : use of pipelines , which avoids retraining and deployment of your model easy, without from scratch .
4. Version Control :






topic : Version control
----------------------------

- In Machine learning , the version control is different.
- Normally ,we use github for version control of code . 
- In machine learning , the version control isnt only dependent on code . It depends on two things :  1. Data 2. Code.

- If data is changed , the model would be different
- if code is changed ie Hyperameter tuning will change in  model and FE , Scaling will change the data, hence model would be different again. 

- Therefore you want the version control in 3 aspects : 
a) Model 
b) Data
c) Code

Ex : For a model A , you have Data A , and Code A . YOu have to version control them together
